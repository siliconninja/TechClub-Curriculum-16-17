# 2016-2017 RHS Tech Club Curriculum
This repository contains an organized selection of resources that were used in the curriculum for the Tech Club at RHS.

Created and used by the leadership committee of the Tech Club during 2016-2017 and a good general resource for starting high school tech/computer clubs.

The format of the club has changed to focus on experimenting with technology and hands-on learning.
