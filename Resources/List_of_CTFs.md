# List of CTFs (by Alphabetical Order/General Difficulty)
CTFTime has only a few of the majority of CTFs listed, so here are the ones that I've found.

**Tip** Check their social media and GitHub pages for people following, related to them, etc. to find more CTFs.

## Everyone
For starters, I recommend participate in 4+ of these to get the gist of how CTFs work before moving onto the Medium section. (Not that you can't do one, it just might seem like their problems are more daunting - they can seem less for those who are very familiar with cybersecurity concepts and CTFs.)

ABCTF (~easy-medium) https://abctf.xyz

EasyCTF (2017 was more ~easy-medium in my opinion) http://easyctf.com/

HSCTF http://hsctf.com/

HSF (2-part CTF, strict team rules) https://hsf.csaw.io/

**PicoCTF - highly recommended (higher point problems range from ~easy to medium-challenging) http://picoctf.com/**
